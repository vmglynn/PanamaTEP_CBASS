# Environmentally-driven holobiont changes impact thermotolerance for Tropical Eastern Pacific corals

#### About
This GitHub repository contains the code and part of the data to recreate the analyses of:

Glynn, V. M., . Environmentally-driven holobiont changes impact thermotolerance for Tropical Eastern Pacific corals. *Global Change Biology*, in review.

#### Contents
This repository contains six folders:

* "Population genetics" : Commands and files used for GenPipes' SNP-by-genotyping analyses, and R scripts for downstream population genetic analyses

* "ITS2" : R scripts for ITS2 marker-gene alpha and beta diversity analyses using SymPortal's taxonomic assignment

* "16S" : R scripts to generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from our 16S marker-gene data using DADA2 (Callahan et al., 2016), the resulting RDS file from DADA2, and alpha and beta diversity analyses of this data

* "Physiology" : R scripts for host protein and chlorophyll *a* models, alongside the associated data  

* "Oxidative Metabolism" : R scripts for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and non-enzymatic total antioxidant capacity (TAC) models, alongside the associated data  

#### Questions
If you have questions about the scripts please contact Victoria Marie Glynn (victoria.glynn@mail.mcgill.ca).
